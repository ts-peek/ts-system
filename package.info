/**
 * Since Windows only supports paths with a maximum of 260 characters, the npm dependency chain may break this constraint, 
 * which in turn prevents tools such as Visual Studio from committing any changes. A possible work around requires to
 * analyze the package dependencies and find all deep dependency nestings. These nestings are the primary reason for the
 * too long paths in Windows. However, when listing a package from in between the deep dependency list as direct root 
 * dependency, npm will take the root package, which shortens the deep path significantly.
 *
 * Following packages are introduced to shorten the maximum path of other packages:
 * - "anymatch": "^1.2.1" // required to short paths for Windows (found as dependency for "karma")
 * - "file-reader": "^1.0.0", // required to short paths for Windows (found as dependency for "anymatch")
